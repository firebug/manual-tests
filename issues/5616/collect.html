<h3>Audacity</h3>
<p>this is a low-end open-source multi-track editor for waveform autio only. it can do wav and ogg and a native aup I think, but NO MIDI. plugins for mp3 are available, however that format's plugins are not legal in many countries due to license requirements.</p>

<h3>Jack Server</h3>
<p>Jack Server is primarily made for linux - this is why the plyugins you see out there only come in source code form, and you need a unix-style compile environment to compile it.  it has a growing set of instruments, including the famous Fender electric pieno I think it is (never found out what it was called).</p>
<p>there are mixers,vu meters, and other things you can use.  SOME pugins are available for windows.  but VERY FEW.</p>

//it is recommended that:
//- a chunk of content which covers multiple id's should be enclosed in nested div tags with single id attributes or similar element to div. only 1 id per element or browser will break.
//- this script should be placed in the body at the end of the html document.
//- suggested you use a div tag with your content in p and h1-6 tags.
//- having id's in the content might mess up the browser. try  a unit test on multiple browserds, it might work -but it may not. so be sure.  
//  the question is whether using .innerHTML duplicates those id's and thus makes that id unusable/invalid.
//- surround your search keywords with <a href="javascript:collect('keyword-with-dashes','regular keyword');">regular keyword</a>
